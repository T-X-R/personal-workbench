# Codex Daily Review Capability

Codex Daily Review is an independent Capability Package. Only when the user selects **Scan and summarize** does it read Codex session files created on the current local date, extract top-level user tasks and their final Codex responses, and ask the Workbench-selected AI Provider for a concise daily review.

Session parsing, task extraction, prompt construction, and presentation are package-owned. The Workbench only supplies the permission-checked `host.codex.sessions.readTodayFiles()` source adapter and the existing `host.ai.invoke` model interface. Child-agent sessions are ignored because they duplicate work already represented by their parent user session.

The package owns its run state and persists the latest completed review for the current local date through Capability-scoped storage. It also submits each completed daily review through the Document Gateway under the stable `daily-reviews/<date>` identity. A manually started review continues across Workbench navigation and is restored after an app restart. Opening the Capability never starts a new scan or AI invocation.

The package requests:

- `codex.sessions.read`: read raw session JSONL files from today's active and archived Codex partitions.
- `ai.invoke`: send compact task evidence to the selected AI Provider.
- `storage`: retain today's generated review and its parsed source metadata across app restarts.

No historical date partition is scanned. Raw session files are not persisted by the Capability, and a saved review from an earlier local date is discarded instead of displayed.
